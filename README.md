# MANA2024 - Working like a data scientist on Jupyter

This workshop covers how to use Jupyter notebook for data analysis and visualization, with a focus on mass spectrometry related metabolomics and isotope tracing data. 

The URL of this repo is https://github.com/shuzhao-li/MANA2024.

PowerPoint slides are included in this repo.

# Downloding Data and Software

For MANA2024, all tutorials will be done in Google Colab so no software is required for download.

In the colab environment, datasets can be downloaded by executing notebook 0.2. On your own machine, this notebook can also install the required software with the exception of jupyter and python. 

## Workshop Outline

The workshop is 75 minutes. We organize it in three modules.

### Module 0. Introduction and Installation

For MANA 2024, all notebooks are available on google colab bypassing the need for installation for the workshop.

This module will not be presented during the workshop but may be useful to workshop attendees who want to use Jupyter on their own after the Workshop.

Module 0 covers how to install Jupyter, what are notebooks, and provides a brief introduction on how to run them. This will not be covered in the workshop.
  - Installation of Jupyter (0.0)
  - Introduction to Jupyter and Notebooks (0.1)
  - Installation of packages used during the workshop and downloading datasets (0.2)

### Module 1. Visualization of mass spectrometry data

Module 1 covers the fundamental concepts in computational mass spectrometry including:
  - Terminology and concepts concerning mass spectrometry data (1.0)
  - The processing of MS data using Asari (1.1) 
  - Visualization of MS data from Asari (1.2)
  - Basic processing of MS data using the PCPFM pipeline (1.3)

### Module 2. Metabolite annotation and isotope tracing data

Module 2 is an overview of metabolite annotation and consideration needed for isotope tracing data.
  - Terminology related to annotation levels and isotope tracing (2.0)
  - Standalone pre-annotation with Khipu (2.1)
  - Generation of Khipugrams for Isotope Tracing Data (2.2)
  - Annotation within the PCPFM pipeline (2.3)

### Module 3. Common statistical analyses and plots

Module 3 is an overview of common statistical tests you may need for metabolomics data processing and related plots.
  - Terminology and overview of statistical concepts presented (3.0)
  - Statistical tests on metabolomics data (3.1)
  - Generation of common plots for metabolomics data (3.2)
