The workshop is 75 minutes. We organize it in three modules.

[reuse code/notebooks from asari, pcpfm, khipu repos]


## Module 1. Visualization of mass spectrometry data

- concepts of a spectrum
- extracting a mass track
- finding an elution peak

- batch processing LC-MS data using asari

- simple workflow with pcpfm pipeline



## Module 2. Metabolite annotation and isotope tracing data

- Concepts of annotation levels and examples from pcpfm
- khipugrams for isotope tracing data


## Module 3. Common statistical analyses and plots

Common stats...
- two group comparison using t-test (parametric), rank sum tes (nonparametric)
- volcano plots
- box plots
- clustermap
