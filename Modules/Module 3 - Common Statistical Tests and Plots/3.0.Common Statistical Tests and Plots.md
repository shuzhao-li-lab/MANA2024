# Module 3 - Common Statistical Tests and Plots

For the majority of experiments, some form of statistical testing is required to identify features of interest and uncover differences between samples. Statistics is also one of the most common steps where errors are introduced, either through mistakes or inappropriate selection of tests and cutoffs. For this reasons, notebooks are great for recording exactly what was done and redistributing the analysis in a reusable manner for reviewers and other scientists. Similarly plotting can be done using notebooks so that figures can be trivially reproduced or altered.
