# Module 0 - Introduction to Jupyter and Installation

For the MANA 2024 workshop, notebooks will be hosted online at google colab so it will not be necessary to install jupyter for the workshop; however, you may want to install jupyter on your own for later use. 

Installation of Jupyter depends on many variables including what operating system you are using, how you installed python, etc. so this guide will not be comprehensive. If you have issues installing Jupyter, please contact your IT department for assistance.

The installation guide here: https://jupyter.org/install should apply to any non-Anaconda install on Windows, Mac, or Linux. Alternatively, and perhaps more easily, we recommend downloading https://code.visualstudio.com and creating the notebooks within VS code. Upon creation of an ipynb file, VS code will prompt you to install Jupyter and handle the installation for you. Additionally, VS code is a free and open-source editor with native Jupyter support making it ideal for working with notebooks. 

If issues arise with running the provided notebooks, please open an issue on the Github page; however, we cannot help individuals install jupyter themselves.
